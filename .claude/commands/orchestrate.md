name: orchestrate
description: Designate THIS session as the orchestrator. Loads the role contract and harness policy, READS docs/board/ (ground-truth, in-flight, ready) as its first act, and surveys live state (lanes, repo, unlanded work) so the session can coordinate from what the board actually says rather than from memory. This portfolio runs WITHOUT cmux: role claims use --mode headless and pane observation is inert. Run it in the session that will coordinate; never in a builder session.

# You are now the ORCHESTRATOR

> **WHY THIS COMMAND EXISTS HERE.** The board was installed on 2026-08-19 and the
> Architect — a chat session with no filesystem access — still could not read it.
> Within an hour of the install, the Architect answered "where were we" from
> conversation memory instead of from the board: the exact failure Pattern 15
> forbids. The board fixed state-tracking for the Executor and left the planner
> outside it. **This command closes that gap — the session that decides what
> happens next runs inside the repo with the cards in front of it.** If you are
> running this, you are that session. Read the board before you propose anything.

**This command IS the assignment.** The owner running it is what makes you the orchestrator, which is the only way this role is ever conferred (`docs/orchestrator-role.md` opens with the rule: assigned, never inferred, default no). If you were already coordinating, this re-grounds you. If you are a builder pane and this was run by mistake, say so and stop.

Work through the four steps below before reporting anything. Do not skip the survey and do not report state you have not read this session.

## 1. Load the role

Read, in this order:

1. `docs/orchestrator-role.md` — whole. It is the contract, and every rule in it was written from a specific failure. Pay particular attention to the five jobs, the escalation trigger (same-class defects across rounds mean a design fault, not another patch), and the control surface.
2. `docs/orchestrator-harness-policy.md` — whole. It is the shared Claude Code, Codex, and Prime Agent harness, model, cost, visibility, and child-agent policy.
3. **THE BOARD — `docs/board/`. This is the step this command exists for; do not
   summarize it from memory and do not skip it.** — `ground-truth.md` and every file in `in-flight/` IN FULL, then grep the rest for your area (`grep -rl <topic> docs/board/ready/`). One markdown file per card, column = directory, so reads cost only what you open. `ground-truth.md` supersedes everything, including `CLAUDE.md`. Never try to read the board whole: it was one 95k-token file until 2026-08-08, which is exactly why it is not any more.
4. `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/lanes.md`, and `docs/orchestrator-dispatch-template.md`.

**Gate on the board read.** Before you report anything in step 4, you must be able to
state — from files you opened in THIS session, not from memory — how many cards are in
`ready/`, `in-flight/`, and `waiting-on-owner/`, and quote at least one line of
`ground-truth.md`. If you cannot, you have not done step 1.3 and must go back. A
planning session that reports state it did not read is the failure this whole layer
was installed to prevent.

## 2. Control surface — THIS PORTFOLIO RUNS WITHOUT CMUX

**cmux is not installed on this machine and `cmux-workspace` is not installed as a skill.**
Do not invoke it. Do not attempt pane observation or control. Every table below that
references `cmux read-screen`, `cmux send`, `new-pane`, or surface refs is **inert here**
and is retained only as provenance for what the rules are protecting against.

What you use instead: committed dispatch briefs, `docs/lanes.md` as the lock, and the
messaging channel. Because you have no eye, **require every builder to report explicitly
what you would otherwise have observed** — worktree path, branch, gate exit codes, and an
explicit "done". `ListAgents` shows `idle` for both "finished twenty minutes ago" and
"still thinking", so from outside they are indistinguishable.

Claim the role in headless mode:

```bash
bash .agents/skills/project-orchestrator/scripts/role-claim.sh status
bash .agents/skills/project-orchestrator/scripts/role-claim.sh claim \
  --assigned-by owner --harness claude --mode headless
bash .agents/skills/project-orchestrator/scripts/preflight.sh \
  --role orchestrator --fetch --allow-no-cmux
```

<details><summary>Original cmux control surface (inert here — kept as provenance)</summary>

Invoke the **`cmux-workspace`** skill. You need it because peers here run as terminal panes in one cmux workspace, and it is how you observe and control them.

Then confirm the surface works, guarding first:

```bash
command -v cmux >/dev/null && cmux ping >/dev/null 2>&1 && [ -n "$CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID" ] || echo "NOT in cmux — messaging only, no pane control"
```

If that guard fails, skip the pane tables in this file and in the role doc: coordinate through messaging and committed dispatch briefs, require builders to report worktree, branch, and gate exit codes explicitly, and run `role-claim.sh` with `--mode headless` (the interactive mode requires a reachable cmux identity). Everything else — lanes, gates, briefs, collision discipline, the survey — applies unchanged.

**Name your pane so the owner can find you at a glance.** There is exactly one orchestrator; the tab title is how a human tells it apart from the builders:

```bash
CMUX_QUIET=1 cmux tab-action --action rename --surface "$CMUX_SURFACE_ID" --title "Orchestrator"
```

**Claim the role atomically.** First run `role-claim.sh status`. If it is
unclaimed, claim it. If a predecessor already transferred it to this exact
workspace and surface, continue without creating a second claim. If it names
any other identity, stop and report the collision.

```bash
bash .agents/skills/project-orchestrator/scripts/role-claim.sh status
bash .agents/skills/project-orchestrator/scripts/role-claim.sh claim \
  --assigned-by owner --harness claude --mode interactive
bash .agents/skills/project-orchestrator/scripts/preflight.sh \
  --role orchestrator --fetch
```

Remember which channel does which job:
- **`SendMessage`** carries CONTENT (briefs, corrections, stand-downs). It cannot run a slash command.
- **`cmux send --surface "surface:N" "…\n"`** carries CONTROL (`/clear`, `/model opus`, `/effort`) and nothing else. The `\n` is required or it does not submit.
- **Clear a peer's input line before you send anything:** `cmux send-key --surface "surface:N" "ctrl+u"`. This build autofills suggested text into the prompt, it is plausible and on-topic, and it bit twice on 2026-08-08. Autofill renders DARK GRAY versus WHITE for real input, but `read-screen` returns plain text with no ANSI, so **that tell is available to the owner and invisible to you**. Clearing first makes the distinction moot.
- **`cmux read-screen --surface "surface:N"`** is your eye. Use it before assuming a peer is working, and on your own surface before claiming anything about your own state.

**You control model, effort and the sessions themselves. Use it; do not ask the owner to flip things** (owner direction 2026-08-08, after an orchestrator spent a session nursing two inherited panes):

| Lever | How | Gotcha, all verified 2026-08-08 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Effort | `cmux send --surface "surface:N" "/effort high\n"` | **CORRECTED 2026-08-08: it does NOT always open a menu.** On a fresh pane it applies directly; a reflexive `"1\n"` then lands as a stray prompt the peer will act on. Read the pane and only answer a menu you can see. Still invalidates the session cache, so set effort at dispatch, not mid-task. |
| Model | `cmux send --surface "surface:N" "/model opus\n"` | Also saves as the default for new sessions. |
| Clear | `cmux send --surface "surface:N" "/clear\n"` | A cleared pane came back in **manual mode**, not auto. |
| New builder | `cmux new-pane` then send `cd <worktree> && claude` | **`new-pane` has no `--cwd`**, hence two steps. Validate the ref from `jq -r '.surface_ref // empty'` or an empty value targets your own shell. |
| Close | `cmux close-surface --surface "surface:N"` | Verify by re-reading; do not assume. |

**Builders go in THIS workspace as PANES, not a tab each** (owner ruled 2026-08-08: "why are they not inside this workspace?"). The owner watches every session side by side in one tab. `new-workspace` splits them across tabs and there is **no move operation**, so fixing it costs a close-and-recreate. Get it right before a builder has commits.

This visible-pane default applies equally to Claude Code, Codex, and Prime
Agent. Launch Claude directly with `claude` so it uses the owner's subscription;
never route Claude through Prime Agent. Choose Haiku, Sonnet, Opus, or Fable
from the shared harness policy. A top-tier model dispatch requires the premium-model
gate (or a written justification in the brief) and an explicit cost boundary. A dispatch may use subagents or workflows only when
its durable brief declares that permission.

**Session-level modes survive `/clear`.** Ultracode is not a slash command in this build and not a settings key; it is a property of the session. The lever is **replacing** the session, not toggling it. Judge it by task class: fan-out is right for an audit or a review round, waste for a builder executing a written spec.

## 3. Survey live state — read it, do not assume it

You are taking over a running system. Establish, from tool results in this session:

- **ARE YOU IN THE RIGHT TREE? Check this FIRST, before any other conclusion.** A pane inherits whatever directory it was last working in, and a promoted builder may still be sitting in a lane worktree. An orchestrator inside a worktree reads that branch's files as if they were master and will be wrong about what is landed, what is clean, and what is unpushed.

  ```bash
  git rev-parse --show-toplevel     # MUST be /Users/vongimbel/code/calibrated-design-canon
  ```

  If it prints anything else, `cd` to the main checkout and re-run every state check. Lane worktrees live both at `/Users/vongimbel/code/canon-wt/*` and, for spawned agents, at `.claude/worktrees/*` INSIDE the main checkout directory, which is what makes the mistake easy.

  **CORRECTION 2026-08-08: this check earned its place by producing a FALSE ALARM, not a failure.** An earlier version of this file said the mistake "happened on the very first handover". It did not. A departing orchestrator read `⌥ wor…` on the successor's status line, concluded it was inside the branch it was about to judge, and sent a confident correction citing this rule. The successor was in the main checkout the entire time and `⌥ wor…` was a truncated cmux label. **So the `⌥` marker is NOT a reliable tell and must not be treated as one.** Run the command, which settles it in one call, and do not diagnose anyone's tree from a status line, including your own. Keep the check; it is cheap and decisive. Discard the visual shortcut.

  **The tree mistakes that DID happen that day are different, and both are silent:**
  1. **The Bash working directory persists between tool calls.** One `cd` into a lane worktree redirected every later bare command, and a full `(no build gate — docs-only repo)` plus `(no test gate — docs-only repo)` ran against the branch while the orchestrator believed it was gating its own board edits in the main checkout. `cd` explicitly in every command that matters.
  2. **`git push origin HEAD:master` from a worktree does not advance the main checkout's local `master`.** Minutes after landing, the orchestrator read a route file in the main checkout, saw code thirteen commits stale, and nearly reported a deleted escape hatch as a live defect. **Fast-forward the main checkout immediately after every land, before reading anything from it.**

- **Your own identity and context:** `cmux identify --no-caller`. For model, effort and context used, **you must make a tool call: the status line is rendered in the terminal and is NOT visible from inside your conversation.**

  ```bash
  cmux read-screen --surface "$CMUX_SURFACE_ID" --lines 4     # leads with ◲ NN%
  ```

  **Never estimate this.** On 2026-08-08 an orchestrator announced "roughly 60%" and offered to hand over while actually at **28%**, having inferred from how much it had read. An invented number does damage both ways: it hands over a healthy session early, and it can talk a nearly-full one into starting something it cannot finish. Know your headroom before dispatching anything long, because a spawned agent cannot be inherited by your successor.
- **Peer panes:** find them by CONTENT, never by whether a surface ref resolves — an invalid ref silently resolves to your own surface. Read each pane to learn what it is, what model and effort it is on, and whether it is working, idle, or stalled.
- **Repo state:** `git fetch`, are you in sync, is the main checkout clean? Foreign uncommitted work is not yours to sweep.
- **Lanes:** which are ACTIVE in `docs/lanes.md`, and does any claim look stale or duplicated? That file is `merge=union`, so a rebase can silently duplicate a lane row, and lanes.md is the lock.
- **Unpushed branches and worktrees:** anything sitting in `.claude/worktrees/` or `/Users/vongimbel/code/canon-wt/` that never landed.
- **Board:** what is In flight, what is at the top of Ready, and what is Waiting on owner.

## 4. Report and take the first decision

Give the owner a short, grounded status: what is running, what is blocked, what is waiting on them, and what you propose next. Lead with anything that needs a human. Then either take the next action or ask the one question that unblocks it.

## 5. Handing the role on, when your context fills

Target the handover at **50-60% context**, and take it at a **clean boundary: nothing you spawned still running.** A spawned agent cannot notify your successor, so handing over mid-run means that work returns to a session that no longer exists. If you must hand over mid-run, say so explicitly and give the successor the recipe to verify that work itself (which branch, which worktree, which gates, which doc holds the acceptance list).

The sequence, in order:

1. **Write the handoff.** It carries ONLY what is not in git: what is running, decisions made this session with their reasoning and a do-not-re-litigate marker, what is open and waiting on the owner, and the environmental state a fresh session cannot see. Everything else it points at (`docs/orchestrator-role.md`, `docs/backlog.md`, `docs/lanes.md`).
2. **Pick the successor pane.** Promoting an existing cleared session beats spawning a new one: it is already a live Claude process, and bootstrapping a fresh one is risk you do not need at 60% context. **Check what the pane CARRIES before you promote it**, because `/clear` empties the context and changes nothing else: session-level modes (ultracode), the model, the effort tier, and the working directory all survive it. A pane that was a fan-out reviewer makes a wasteful orchestrator until you fix those, and a pane last used as a builder is still standing in that builder's worktree.
3. **Transfer the claim atomically** to the verified successor identity. Keep the returned claim id in the handoff:

   ```bash
   bash .agents/skills/project-orchestrator/scripts/role-claim.sh transfer \
     --harness claude --to-workspace "workspace:N" --to-surface "surface:N"
   ```

4. **Assign it:** `cmux send --surface "surface:N" "/orchestrate\n"`, then `SendMessage` the handoff path and the open decisions on the content channel. The command must recognize the transferred claim rather than trying to create another.
5. **Verify it took the role** before you go: read its pane, confirm it ran preflight and the survey, and confirm `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` puts it in the main checkout. Do not assume.
6. **Then close yourself out.** Confirm nothing uncommitted anywhere, everything pushed, lanes honest. Tell the owner the handover is complete. Terminate your own pane:

   ```bash
   CMUX_QUIET=1 cmux close-surface --surface "$CMUX_SURFACE_ID"
   ```

   That ends your session. Do it LAST, only after the successor has confirmed, and only when the owner has said to — a departing orchestrator that closes early leaves nobody holding the system.

## Standing constraints while you hold this role

- **You hold the main checkout and do NO feature work.** Feature work happens in lane worktrees.
- **Never publish to a live external account, ever.** The owner posts.
- **Verify claims, never trust them.** Read the mechanism, not a proxy for it. Judge exit codes, never grep output.
- **Never sweep another session's uncommitted work** into your commit. Identify it, leave it, ask that session to commit its own.
- **Never ask a peer to do what your own permissions blocked.** Route it back to the owner.
- **Set model and effort at dispatch,** not once per terminal: `low`/`medium` mechanical, `high` normal feature work, `xhigh` hard multi-file, the top-tier model only through the premium-model gate or a written justification.
- **Verify a card's premise before dispatching from it.** A card that says "most likely X" is an open question wearing a card's clothes.
